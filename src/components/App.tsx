   drawer 40, hamburger 30), which contradicted the theme's scale and put the
   drawer's scrim BELOW any `z-sticky` element (50): a sticky section bar stayed
   bright on top of the dimmed page and could paint over the drawer itself. The

 * The header banner artwork (non-hero variant), restored 2026-09-25.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS BACK. The non-hero header (`/public`, `/loker`, `/share`, …) had
 * lost its banner: `bannerStore` was imported and never read, so every route
 * except the hero on `/` rendered a bare `hero-gradient` with no artwork. The
 * owner's item 3 asks for the banner asset back on the `asj-files` Supabase path
 * the legacy portal used.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXACT STRINGS. They are the legacy structure the owner chose, and
 * both filenames are ALREADY live in this repo — `LayananSection.astro:31,114`
 * fetch `sakra_banner.webp` and `dark_tokyo_banner.webp` from this same base.
 * Reusing them (rather than inventing names) keeps one source of truth for the
 * URLs; `sakra` is the legacy spelling and must NOT be "corrected" to `sakura`,
 * or the request 404s.
 *
 * WHY THE MAP DEFAULT IS TOKYO. `BannerTheme` also has `INTER_VIP`; anything
 * that is not `SAKURA` resolves to the Tokyo artwork, matching the legacy
 * default. `bannerStore` is a `persistentAtom`, so flipping the theme swaps the
 * artwork — which is the whole reason the store exists.

  /* One logo element for both header variants.
     It used to be written twice — once per branch — which meant two copies of the
     inline error handler, and the second copy cost a `noExplicitAny` diagnostic on
     a file that is already at its ratchet ceiling (measured: lint-ratchet reported
     "src/components/App.tsx: 17 -> 20" with noExplicitAny +1). Lifting it into one
     const keeps the count where it was and removes the chance of the two copies
     drifting. The size is the EXISTING one, so every route that already renders
     this header is unchanged; only the new hero variant adopts it.

     could show**, fetched from a third-party CDN on EVERY page. `Footer.astro` had
     already made exactly this swap, and recorded the reasoning: `/icons/logo-asj.webp`
     is the same emblem WITH an alpha channel, so it drops onto the header gradient
     with no white box, and it is already committed and already published — no new
     asset, no new §11.2 decision. Verified by rendering both side by side before the
     swap, not assumed from the name.
     `onError` was there so a failed CDN fetch would not show a broken icon; a file
     that ships with the build cannot fail that way, and silently hiding the brand
     mark is the wrong behaviour for it. Removing it also drops one `any`. */

          which made "kembali ke atas" impossible to express as a link and left
          the landing page's topmost band as its only unnamed landmark — L3 gave
          every other section a name.

          `id="atas"` is on the <header> itself, so the anchor IS the band you
          see; no extra element and no extra nesting. It only materialises when
          `hero` is set, which is true on this landing route and false on the
          other four that mount App without it — there the header is chrome, not
          a page section, and an `#atas` anchor would be meaningless.

          `scroll-mt-24` is load-bearing, not cosmetic: the site nav is fixed, so
          without it an in-page jump parks the hero's eyebrow under the nav bar.

          The page's single h1 lives inside this hero, and
          `e2e/test-headings.mjs` enforces exactly one h1 per route, so a second
          heading here would break it.

          REMOVED (2026-09-19): this element used to carry
          `aria-label="Atas halaman"` when it was the hero. Biome reports
          `aria-label` as unsupported on a plain `<header>` (src/components/App.tsx:242,
          a lint ERROR, and it was one of two diagnostics this change added), and
          the label was never load-bearing: `e2e/test-landing.mjs:530` decides a
          section has an accessible name by looking for a HEADING inside it
          (`hasHeading`, any of h1..h6), which the hero already has. Naming the
          landmark is the job of that heading, not of an aria-label here. */}
      {/* ─── THE TWO HEADER VARIANTS ARE NOW TWO SEPARATE CLASS STRINGS ───
          Owner request 2026-09-27: the landing hero becomes a full-bleed,
          one-screen band (the reference is a short with a full-screen
          illustrated scene, an oversized serif headline and a scroll-driven
          parallax). Splitting the string is a FIX, not a tidy-up: it used to
          be one common string with a swapped tail, so the hero's geometry
          could only be reached by editing text that five other routes also
          render. Those routes (`/loker`, `/public`, `/admin`, `/candidate`,
          `/share`) mount this header WITHOUT `hero` and must keep the
          `max-w-7xl … rounded-band min-h-[14rem] md:h-56` chrome box exactly
          as it is — including the title-clipping fix recorded in the
          non-hero branch below (the `max-w-[210px]` cap removal, 672d2f1).
          Two strings means a change to one cannot leak into the other.

          HERO (`/` only) — full-bleed, one screen tall:
            · no `max-w-7xl` / `mx-auto` / `px-4` / `mt-6` → edge to edge
            · no `rounded-band` / `border` / `shadow-2xl`  → no card edges
            · NO `overflow-hidden` — `.hero-band` (global.css) supplies
              `overflow: clip` instead. This is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
              `hidden` establishes a SCROLL CONTAINER, and
              `animation-timeline: view()` resolves against the subject's
              nearest scroll container, so the parallax planes in motion.css
              §9e would freeze at a single offset while the stylesheet looked
              completely correct. `clip` clips the same pixels and creates no
              scroll container. It is also what stops the oversized planes
              from painting over the next section.
            · `.hero-band` supplies `min-height: 100svh` — `svh` and not
              `vh`, because on a phone `vh` is measured against the LARGEST
              viewport and the band would be taller than the screen, parking
              the CTA under the address bar. */}

            other route that mounts the header without a hero keeps the bare
            gradient). It sits UNDER the content because the band's existing
            children are not positioned, so a plain absolutely-positioned
            sibling paints first and the flex row of text lands on top.

            `aria-hidden` + `alt=""` is deliberate and is NOT the same choice as
            the program tiles: the hero already states its meaning in the h1
            ("Karier ke Jepang, dimulai dari sini."), so the scene restates it.
            Announcing it again would make a screen reader read the same idea
            twice.

            The gradient is kept as the fallback and the image fades over it via
            opacity, rather than replacing it: the band's gradient and the
            artwork share the same dusk palette, so the two blend into one
            surface instead of meeting at a hard edge. It is `object-cover` so
            the art fills a band whose height varies from 26rem (mobile) to
            32rem (desktop) without distorting.

            THE ART WAS REPLACED BY THE OWNER, 2026-09-24. The old asset was a
            flat-vector scene; the new one is a generated 2.75:1 banner (sakura,
            Fuji, a pagoda, a figure in an ASJ PORTAL jacket) supplied by the
            owner from `F:\asset`. Two consequences recorded here because they
            are not visible from the markup:

              · `width`/`height` moved 1600x900 -> 1600x582, the real size of the
                1x file. They no longer describe a 16:9 art. (They reserve no
                layout box either way — this <picture> is `absolute inset-0
                w-full h-full` — but a wrong intrinsic size is still a false
                statement about the asset.)
              · `@2x` is the source's NATIVE ceiling (2079x756), not a true 2x.
                The band is 1248 CSS px wide and `object-cover` scales by height,
                so 2x DPR wants ~2818px and the source cannot supply it. It is
                left un-upscaled on purpose: inventing pixels and calling them
                resolution is worse than shipping fewer real ones.

            `loading="eager"` because this is the LCP element's backdrop; lazy
            here would delay the largest paint on the page the visitor sees
            first. */}

             A second copy of the band's own `--hero-glow` token, re-positioned
             and enlarged, drifting further than the artwork above it.

             The depth cue is the DIFFERENCE IN RATE (it travels ~2.75x as far,
             so it reads as closer to the camera). It also travels the opposite
             way, and that part is an aesthetic choice rather than a principle —
             two planes moving the same way at different speeds is the textbook
             parallax. See the full note in motion.css §9e; it is stated there
             because the earlier version of both comments dressed the direction
             up as a law of perception, which it is not.

             WHY IT IS IN THE UPPER-RIGHT (`background-position: 80% 30%`, set
             in CSS). The hero copy sits at the bottom-left and the
             `.header-overlay` scrim exists to hold its contrast. A pink bloom
             behind a white headline raises the backdrop's luminance and eats
             exactly that contrast — and because this plane drifts, it would
             carry that bloom in and out of the copy's row across the scroll
             range. Keeping it up and right keeps the contrast independent of
             scroll position.

             It is placed AFTER the <picture> so it paints over the artwork and
             BEFORE `.header-overlay` so the scrim still wins — all three are
             positioned with no z-index (or `z-0`), so tree order is the paint
             order. Pure gradient: no image, no filter, no `backdrop-filter`,
             so a scroll-linked transform on it stays on the compositor.

             `pointer-events-none` for the same reason the artwork and the
             overlay carry it: it covers the whole band and must never
             intercept a click meant for the CTA. */}

        {/* Non-hero header artwork — RESTORED 2026-09-25 (owner item 3).
             Every route except `/` mounts the header without the hero, and this
             band was left with a bare gradient. It now carries the theme-driven
             banner from the legacy `asj-files` path; `bannerSrc` flips with
             `bannerStore` (SAKURA ⇄ TOKYO), which is what a theme change should
             visibly do.

             Same geometry contract as the hero picture: `absolute inset-0 -z-0`
             so it paints UNDER the (unpositioned) flex children, `object-cover`
             so the band's varying height never distorts the art, and
             `opacity-60` so the band's gradient still reads through it — the
             two share a palette and must not meet at a hard edge. `aria-hidden`
             + `alt=""` because it is decorative: the header's own text carries
             the meaning, exactly as the hero-branch comment explains.

             No `srcset`/`width`/`height`: the legacy asset is a single remote
             file with no @2x sibling, and asserting an intrinsic box we do not
             know would be a false statement about it (same reasoning the hero
             comment records for its own size change). `loading="lazy"` — unlike
             the hero, this band is not the LCP element on these routes. */}

             It is a DIRECTIONAL gradient, not a scrim: transparent over the far
             side of the band, dark only where the copy sits (bottom on a phone,
             left at `lg`). `.header-overlay` in global.css is re-aimed to the
             text's side and darkens in BOTH themes, because the hero copy stays
             white in both (global.css §5d).

             RESTORED 2026-09-24. The div that carried this class was removed in
             84c7ed6 with the note that "the CSS gradient in `.hero-gradient`
             already has the right contrast" — true of the bare gradient, but the
             hero has since gained the `hero-sakura` illustration at
             `opacity-60`, and it is the ARTWORK that sits behind the headline
             now. With the class orphaned (0 elements), the headline measured a
             worst glyph-background of 2.36-2.88:1 in light mode, under the 3:1
             floor. It is decorative, so `aria-hidden` + `pointer-events-none`.

             ⚠ NOW APPLIED TO BOTH VARIANTS, 2026-09-25. It used to be
             `{hero && …}` because only the hero carried artwork. The non-hero
             header now carries the theme banner too (item 3), so the overlay is
             no longer conditioned on `hero` — gating it on the hero would leave
             the non-hero header's white copy sitting directly on the artwork.
             MEASURED on `/public` 1280, glyph row sampled with the header text
             hidden so only the backdrop is read: dark 9.64:1; light varies with
             the banner artwork as it paints — 12.8:1 over the bare gradient down
             to **3.35:1** once a bright `sakra_banner.webp` petal lands behind
             the copy. All clear the 3:1 floor, the light one by design margin.
             NOTE the light figure depends on global.css §5d's band SELF-match
             rule as well as this overlay: without it the non-hero h1 inherited
             §5b's `#1f1d1c` and measured **1.21:1** against this same backdrop
             (it was ALREADY 1.10:1 at HEAD, before the banner — a pre-existing
             defect this task surfaced and fixes). See the §5d comment. */}

             DESIGN.md:582 ("Tinggi minimum | 44 px") and DESIGN.md:691

             like these two were outside that gate's reach, which is exactly how
             they drifted under the floor without anything going red.

             Sizes are now literal 11 (44px) rather than a min-h, because these
             are fixed icon buttons inside a rounded-full pill: a min-height
             would let the circle stay 40px tall while only the tap box grew,
             which reads as a misaligned control. `gap-2` is unchanged, so the

             WHY THE HERO LIVES IN App.tsx AND NOT IN ITS OWN .astro FILE.
             The band's background is the theme artwork, and that value lives in
             `bannerStore` — browser-only state that App already resolves and
             already listens to (`asj-theme-change`). A separate Astro hero would
             need its own copy of the theme→artwork map, which would be the THIRD
             copy (App.tsx and Footer.astro already each carry one). Duplicating
             it a third time to satisfy a file layout is the wrong trade: the
             footer's copy is already justified in its own comment only because
             it is an island-free script.

             WHY THE COMPANY NAME IS A `div` HERE. `e2e/test-headings.mjs`
             enforces exactly one h1 per route, and it is right to: an h1 that
             reads "PT AMANAH SAKURA JAPAN" does not say what the page is
             (WCAG 2.4.2). On this route the headline below is the h1, so the
             company name steps down. On every other route the header keeps the

                  This h1 carried no colour class until 2026-09-20 and inherited
                  `--color-fg` from the theme. That worked only while light mode's
                  `--color-fg` happened to be `#f1f5f9` (near-white), which is the
                  right colour for the hero POLARITY but came from the wrong place:
                  it is the PAGE text token, and the light palette has since been
                  retuned to `#16121c` so body copy reads on the white canvas.

                  Measured consequence of the retune, in a browser against a real
                  server — the hero h1 resolved to `rgb(31, 29, 28)` on a
                  `linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(42,18,53) …)` band: contrast
                  **1.01:1**, i.e. effectively invisible. The h1 of the landing page.

                  The band is deliberately dark in BOTH themes (see the note on
                  --hero-gradient in theme.css), so the heading's colour must not be
                  derived from the theme at all. Its siblings already name theirs —
                  `text-pink-300` on the eyebrow, `text-slate-200` on the sub — which
                  is exactly why only the one colourless element broke. */}

                  full-screen hero with an oversized SERIF display headline.
                  `font-display` swaps Inter for Instrument Serif (20.5 KB,
                  latin, one weight — see BaseLayout.astro and theme.css).

                  `font-normal` IS NOT OPTIONAL. The family ships weight 400
                  ONLY, so leaving the old `font-black` would ask the browser
                  to SYNTHESISE a 900 — a smeared fake on a high-contrast
                  serif, which is the worst possible face to fake bold on.
                  The hierarchy this loses is bought back by SIZE: the
                  display tier was retuned to a 72 px ceiling (theme.css
                  `--text-display`).

                  `leading-tight` was REMOVED at the same time. It (1.25) was
                  overriding the `text-display` token's own leading, so the
                  token's line-height was dead on this element; a display
                  serif wants the tighter 1.02 the token now carries, and
                  having one owner for the leading is the point of the token.

                  The `text-white` note below still applies unchanged — the
                  band is dark in BOTH themes, so the colour must not come

                (5 of 12 columns), so three tiles across it are ~152px each:
                enough for a 4-digit number over a two-word caption at the
                `text-caption` size, and it is what makes the strip read as a
                summary rather than a list.

                WHY `sm:grid-cols-3` AND NOT `grid-cols-3`. Forcing three columns
                at every width fixed the desktop stack and BROKE mobile: at 390px
                the tiles became 106px wide and 106px tall (from 73px), and

                  was added because the title box (x ends 287) and the menu

                  do not overlap VERTICALLY, and never did: the button is
                  `absolute top-4` (y 41..85) while the title sits at the bottom

                  vertical overlap**, so no text ever rendered under the button.

                  The old comment claimed "51px renders *under* the button",
                  which is an x-only comparison. Do not re-add a cap on that
                  reasoning; compare the two RECTANGLES, not their x-ranges.

                  Measured effect of removing it (`h1 clientWidth/scrollWidth`,
                  and the full name is 274px):
                    320px  210 -> 211   360px  210 -> 251
                    390px  210 -> 281 (FULL)   414px  210 -> 305 (FULL)
                    /admin 320 -> 271 (FULL), 768 -> 671 (FULL)
                  So the company name is now complete from 390px up instead of
                  permanently ellipsised. No horizontal overflow at any width.

                  `truncate` STAYS and `App.header.test.tsx` still enforces it
                  ("memotong judul dengan elipsis, bukan melipatnya"); wrapping
                  was tried as `line-clamp-2` on 2026-09-25 and reverted. */}

                    Demoting it globally would leave those routes with no h1 at
                    all, which is why the hero variant above is opt-in.

                    ⚠ `truncate` STAYS, AND `App.header.test.tsx` ENFORCES IT
                    ("memotong judul dengan elipsis, bukan melipatnya"). This was
                    TRIED as `line-clamp-2` on 2026-09-25 to stop the company name
                    rendering as "PT AMANAH SAKUR…" on a phone, and the test caught
                    it. Measured before reverting, at /loker:
                      · 390px  line-clamp-2 -> title ends x=281, button starts 314, clears by 27px
                      · 360px  line-clamp-2 -> title ends x=281, button starts 284, OVERLAPS
                      · 320px  line-clamp-2 -> title ends x=281, button starts 244, OVERLAPS by 43px
                      · `truncate` at the same widths -> the BOX is the same 210px, so
                        it overlaps at 360/320 too. Wrapping bought nothing there.
                    So the ellipsis is not what protects the button — the
                    `max-w-[210px]` cap is, and that cap is simply too wide below
                    ~370px. Making the cap responsive is a real change with its own
                    risk, so it is REPORTED rather than smuggled in under a UX
                    sweep. Do not swap this class without re-running the measured
                    comparison above. */}

          convenience: the drawer carries its own labelled close button and the
          hamburger above toggles, so nothing is lost by keeping it out of the
          a11y tree. Left as a bare clickable div it measured as a nameless
          `u-modal-shell` overlay — indistinguishable, to a screen reader, from
          the real modals beside it (§25).

          `.js-scrim` IS LOAD-BEARING — do not remove it. The light-theme shim
          in global.css remaps `bg-black/NN` to a pale surface for cards, and it
          exempts real scrims via `:not(.inset-0)`. This scrim gets its geometry
          from `.u-viewport-fixed`, NOT `inset-0`, so it slipped the exemption
          and was repainted OPAQUE. MEASURED light-theme, drawer open: computed
          background was `rgb(239,233,239)` (opacity 1) hiding the whole page;
          dark theme was correct at `oklab(0 0 0 / 0.7)`. `.js-scrim` is the

          `u-viewport-fixed--right` rather than `fixed top-0 right-0 h-full`:
          with `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on <html>, a plain `right: 0` on a

                (the announcement marquee, the live-vacancy count strip and the
                `<SiteNav />` section bar). That bar's "Lowongan" item was the
                ONLY `href="/loker"` anywhere in `src/**` — measured, every other
                hit is prose and `Footer.astro` links four fragments only. So the
                link moves here, where the owner said it belongs ("dari menu
                hamburger").

                WHY IT SITS ABOVE THE AUTH BLOCK AND NOT INSIDE IT. Every other
                link in this drawer is behind a role check (`u.isLoggedIn &&`), so
                a logged-out visitor would have had no path to the vacancies at

                `profile.nav_loker` is deliberately the SAME key the deleted bar
                used: it is the same link with the same word, and re-keying it
                would orphan the translations for no gain. It is now the key's
