/**
 * GalleryGrid.tsx — the photo gallery (R3).
 *
 * WHY .tsx AND NOT .astro
 * -----------------------
 * Same reason as IconTileGrid.tsx, PersonGrid.tsx and StepList.tsx: it iterates,
 * and a `.map()` inside an `.astro` template is reported by the indexer as an
 * unresolved global. `indexer/src/build.test.ts` asserts zero unresolved records,
 * so the list lives here.
 *
 * NO LIGHTBOX, DELIBERATELY
 * -------------------------
 * The obvious next feature is a click-to-zoom overlay. It is not here because a
 * second modal component means a second focus trap, a second Escape handler and a
 * second scroll lock, and `e2e/test-dialog.mjs` already proves the app has exactly
 * one dialog contract. A gallery that opens its own overlay would be a third place
 * for that contract to drift. The tiles are large enough to read; zoom can arrive
 * later, reusing the existing modal, rather than inventing a parallel one.
 *
 * WHY `loading="lazy"` IS SET PER TILE AND NOT ON THE FIRST ONE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * The first row is within a screen of the hero on a desktop viewport, so letting
 * it load eagerly gives a painted gallery instead of a pop-in. Everything after
 * the third tile is genuinely below the fold and is deferred.
 *
 * WHY THE ASPECT BOX IS EXPLICIT
 * ------------------------------
 * Every tile reserves `4 / 3` and the image inside uses `object-cover`. Without a
 * reserved box the nine images would each set their own height as they arrive and
 * push the footer down in nine steps — the same layout shift class the hero was
 * measured for.
