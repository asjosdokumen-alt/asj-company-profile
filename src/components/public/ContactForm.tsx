/**
 * ContactForm.tsx — the public contact form in the `#kontak` section.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 * --------------------------------
 * This is the ONLY unauthenticated WRITE in the deployment. A visitor has no
 * account — that is the whole point of a company contact form, because requiring
 * one would mean only existing users could ask how to become one. The server side
 * of that decision (validation, length bounds, per-number rate limiting, the
 * honeypot, and why the reply is deliberately vague) lives in
 * `netlify/functions/contexts/contact/service.ts`; read that file for the
 * security reasoning. This file owns only what the visitor sees.
 *
 * THE HONEYPOT, AND WHY ITS LABEL IS INVISIBLE RATHER THAN ABSENT
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * A bot fills every input it can find; a person never sees this one. Two
 * consequences shape the markup:
 *
 *   - It is NOT `type="hidden"`. A naive scraper is often smart enough to skip
 *     explicitly hidden fields, which would defeat the trap. It is a normal text
 *     input that is visually hidden and removed from the tab order, so it looks
 *     like an ordinary field to anything parsing the DOM and like nothing at all
 *     to a person.
 *   - It carries `tabIndex={-1}` AND `aria-hidden`. Without both, a keyboard
 *     user would tab into an invisible box and a screen reader would announce a
 *     field that has no meaning. `autocomplete="off"` keeps a password manager
 *     from helpfully filling it in and getting an honest visitor silently
 *     blackholed — which is the one failure mode of a honeypot that actually
 *     harms someone.
 *
 * The `name` is `perusahaan` ("company"), which is plausible enough to attract a
 * bot that scrapes field names for something business-shaped, and is the exact
 * string `service.ts` reads via its `HONEYPOT_FIELD` constant.
 *
 * SESSION OPTIONS ARE NOT DEFAULTS, ON PURPOSE
 * -------------------------------------------
 * `apiClient` defaults to `requireAuth: true` and `onSessionInvalid: 'logout'`.
 * Left alone, an anonymous visitor would be REFUSED (no session) and then
 * redirected to `/` — so the form would look like it submitted and the page
 * would jump. Both are overridden for the obvious reason: this page is public.
 *
 * `silent: true` because this component owns its error presentation (inline
 * message + toast), and the client's own toast would otherwise double every
 * failure. `onSessionInvalid: 'throw'` rather than 'logout' for the same reason
 * the landing page's other public callers use it: a public visitor must never be
 * logged out or redirected by a background call.
 *
 * WHY A SUCCESS STATE RATHER THAN A RESET FORM
 * -------------------------------------------
 * A cleared form looks identical to one that failed silently. Replacing it with
 * a confirmation removes that ambiguity, states when a reply can be expected,
 * and offers the WhatsApp route for anyone who needs an answer sooner. The
 * confirmation is a live region (`role="status"`) so a screen-reader user hears
 * it instead of being left on a form that apparently did nothing.

 * rendered 295x40. DESIGN.md:582 sets the minimum at 44px and, for buttons
 * inside a mobile form, at 48px. Submitting this form is the single conversion
 * the contact section exists for, so it gets the 48px tier rather than the 44px
 * floor. The submit button beside these fields already carried
 * `min-h-[44px]` (see the comment on it below), so the fields were the only
 * controls in this form under the standard.
 *
 * `min-h-12` (48px) and not `h-12`: the `pesan` field is a `resize-y` textarea
 * and a fixed height would fight the resize handle.

          NOT invented, because `Button.astro` is an `.astro` component and
          cannot be imported into this `.tsx` island.

          The first version of this button used `bg-accent text-accent-fg`, and
          `verify:classes` failed it: `text-accent-fg` has no rule, so the label
          would have rendered unstyled. That gate was right and the cause is a
          documented trap — DESIGN.md §3.2 and `button.test.ts` are both explicit
          that `--color-accent` is the LIGHT accent for text and icons on a dark
          surface, and is far below AA as a SOLID FILL. The solid tiers are the
          -600/-700 steps; pink-600 is measured at 4.60:1 against white.

          The two rules Button.astro also enforces and this must keep:
            - `min-h-[44px]` — the §6.4 touch minimum as a min-height, so a later
              padding trim cannot push the target below the floor;
            - hover DARKENS (-600 -> -700). Every other button in the repo does;
              a control that lightens on hover reads as disabled. */}
