/**
 * PersonGrid.tsx — the team grid: one card per role, with a name only when the
 * company profile publishes one.
 *
 * WHY THE NAME IS OPTIONAL
 * ------------------------
 * Six roles come from the official organisation structure (company profile page 8),
 * and TODAY all six carry a printed name — the document publishes every one. The
 * field stays nullable because the rule it encodes is the point: a person is named
 * only when the company profile publishes them, and a `name` field that always
 * rendered would force an unnamed role to say something — which is how a placeholder
 * like "Staff" or, worse, an invented name, ends up on a public company page. So
 * `name: null` remains a real, supported state: it renders an honest "Belum
 * dipublikasikan" instead of an empty gap that reads as a layout bug. No row uses it
 * right now; `e2e/test-landing.mjs` ties this branch's output to the data so the two
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The credential note is rendered under the role rather than in its own column
 * because JLPT N1 belongs to ONE of these people, and a detached badge would read as
 * a company-wide claim. The separate credential card above the grid carries the
 * certificate number; this line is the human attribution.
 *
 * WHY THE NAME CARRIES A `data-lang` KEY. A name is a NAME, not an identifier, so
 * it follows the language toggle — see the rule comment in companyProfile.ts. Before
 * this, the six names were plain literals, and e2e/probe-untranslated.mjs caught all
 * six unchanged on / , /loker and /public inside a section whose every other word had
 * switched to Japanese. The NAME key is what makes the toggle reach them.
 *
 * WHY .tsx AND NOT .astro — see the long note in IconTileGrid.tsx. Short version: it
 * iterates, and iterating inside an `.astro` template breaks the indexer's
 * zero-unresolved invariant.
