/**
 * IconTileGrid.tsx — icon + heading + one supporting line, as a bento grid.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Three sections need the same shape: "Why Japan" (3 tiles), "Program ASJ" (3) and
 * "Facilities" (6). Writing the tile markup once per section is how the padding, the
 * radius and the icon size end up different in each one — the measured drift that
 * DESIGN.md §3.5 and §4.2 exist to stop.
 *
 * WHY .tsx AND NOT .astro
 * -----------------------
 * It is a data-driven list, so it iterates, and iterating in an `.astro` TEMPLATE
 * breaks a hard invariant of this repo. `indexer/src/build.test.ts:428` requires
 * ZERO unresolved references originating outside a test file, and the indexer
 * resolves `.astro` template interpolations against the FRONTMATTER MODULE SCOPE
 * only — so a `.map()` callback parameter inside an `.astro` template is reported as
 * an unresolved global (measured: 21 entries, every one a callback parameter). The
 * same code in `.tsx` binds correctly, which is why `App.tsx` has always iterated
 * freely.
 *
 * The two ways out were to teach the indexer nested template scopes, or to stop
 * writing that pattern. A third — adding a filter to the assertion — was rejected:
 * the test's own comment asks for that assertion to be COLLAPSED back to
 * `length === 0` as gaps close, so adding a filter moves the repo the wrong way.
 *
 * A `.tsx` component used WITHOUT a `client:*` directive is server-rendered to
 * static HTML by Astro and ships no JavaScript. That is what makes this the cheap
 * fix rather than an architectural one.
 *
 * THE CARD RULES IT ENFORCES (DESIGN.md §4.2), so a caller cannot get them wrong:
 *  - grid: 1 column below `sm`, 2 at `sm`, `columns` at `lg` — the bento ladder.
 *  - every tile shares one padding rhythm; a grid of tiles with different internal
 *    padding reads as hand-placed rather than composed.
 *  - `min-w-0` on every tile, so a long unbroken string truncates or wraps instead
 *    of pushing the grid wider than the viewport — the most common cause of
 *    horizontal scroll on this page.
 *
 * COPY BUDGET. The body is `line-clamp-2`: DESIGN.md §4.2 allows at most 30 words per
 * bento card. The clamp is not decoration — it is what stops a long translation from
 * silently turning a bento grid into a wall of text, and it fails visibly.
 *
 * The heading level is `h3` and deliberately not configurable: a tile is always
 * inside a section that owns an `h2`, and a tile that could emit an `h2` would let a
 * page grow two competing section titles — the defect `e2e:headings` checks for.

    //
    // `data-scroll-item` is the CONTINUOUS half (§9f), and it is on this <ul>
    // rather than on each <li> for the reason §9f records: a scroll-linked
    // `transform` on the same element as a §9c hover recipe overrides that
    // recipe outright. The only hover here is `.u-zoom` on the <img>, so a
    // drift on the <li> would in fact coexist — but it would also move the
    // card's own border and background, and the tile would read as sliding
    // out of its own grid cell. The GRID is the thing that moves; the cards
    // stay registered to it. Same structure as §9's stagger: one attribute on
    // the container, children handled by `> *`.

          {/* The illustration, when the tile carries one, sits ABOVE the icon
              and bleeds to the card's own padding edge via a negative margin —
              `-mx-5 -mt-5 md:-mx-6 md:-mt-6` cancels exactly the `p-5 md:p-6`
              above. That is why `overflow-hidden` is on the <li>: without it
              the image's square corners poke past the card's radius. A wrapper
              with its own padding would also work but would leave the card's
              visual edge inset from the image, which reads as a double frame.

              `aspect-[3/2]` is fixed rather than derived from the file, because
              the ratio must be reserved BEFORE the image loads — deriving it
              from the decoded file is what causes layout shift. All three
              program illustrations ship at 600x400, so 3/2 is their true
              ratio, not an approximation. It was `4/3` until 2026-09-28, when
              the artwork was replaced; the ratio follows the artwork, so the
              two moved together rather than leaving `object-cover` to crop
              14% of every card's width. */}
