/**
 * gallery.ts — the photo gallery (R3), and the deliberate omissions behind it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS SHORT
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Twenty-six company photographs exist and were sitting unused outside the repo.
 * Shipping all of them would have been the easy move and the wrong one: several
 * are not photographs of the company at all, and two are actively unsafe to
 * publish. Every entry below earns its place, and every omission is recorded here
 * rather than left as a silent gap — so the next person does not "helpfully" add
 * the missing files back.
 *
 * WHAT WAS LEFT OUT, AND WHY
 * --------------------------
 *   - `legal-ahu-0063921-2023.webp` and `legal-akta-09-2023.webp`
 *     Full-page scans of the ministerial decree and the notarial deed. These carry
 *     the personal signature and the printed name of an official who is not our
 *     employee and did not consent to appearing on a job portal. They also carry a
 *     QR code and a personal NIP. The licence NUMBERS already ship as text in
 *     LEGAL_FACTS, which is the part a candidate actually needs to verify the
 *     company. The scans add no verification value that the numbers do not, and
 *     they publish a third party's signature. Omitted deliberately.
 *
 *   - `fasilitas-kelas-bahasa-1.webp`
 *     A CCTV frame, not a photograph: a timestamp is burned into the image
 *     ("02-03-2025 10:01:52"), the camera's own brand is watermarked in the corner,
 *     and students are visible from a surveillance angle. Publishing it tells a
 *     candidate the classroom is monitored, which is not the message this section
 *     exists to send. A better classroom photo of the same room already exists
 *     (`fasilitas-kelas-bahasa-2.webp`), so nothing is lost. Omitted deliberately.
 *
 *   - `poster-rekrutmen.webp`
 *     A recruitment flyer with marketing text baked into the picture ("AYO Kerja ke
 *     Jepang", "HANYA 6 Jt"). Those claims are already rendered as real, translatable
 *     text in PROGRAMS and PROGRAM_PRICE. Shipping the flyer would duplicate them at
 *     842x1192 px, freeze them out of the language toggle, and show a price that
 *     cannot be updated without redrawing an image. Omitted deliberately.
 *
 *   - `galeri-mensetsu-*.webp` (5 files)
 *     Interview-day posters with a designed frame, a title band and a contact
 *     footer composited in. As gallery tiles they read as advertisements rather than
 *     as photographs of the day, and the footer duplicates contact details that the
 *     page already shows as text. Kept out of the gallery.
 *
 * WHAT THAT LEAVES
 * ----------------
 * Eight genuine photographs, all pointing the same direction: people, rooms, and
 * arrival in Japan. That is the story this section has to tell.
 *
 * THREE OF THEM WERE NOT GENUINE UNTIL 2026-09-20
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * This file's whole premise is "every entry is a photograph of the company". Three
 * entries broke it, and the thing that hid the break was the gate below it: the test
 * checks that each `src` EXISTS ON DISK and that its declared size matches, and all
 * three did. The bytes were simply not of this company.
 *
 * The mapping that produced them (`F:\desain\_cp_assets.py`) pointed three slots at
 * PDF bleed artwork instead of photographs:
 *   - `tim-koirul-mustakim.webp`   held Tokyo Skytree + cherry blossom
 *   - `tim-hadi-prasojo.webp`      held a red-maple footpath
 *   - `galeri-keberangkatan-1.webp` held a red maple and a pagoda
 * The two real portraits were invisible for a mundane reason: `_cp_images.py`
 * discarded images under 40,000 pixels, and the portraits measure 41,087 (barely
 * through) and 25,800 (never written at all). The real departure photographs — four
 * of them, participants holding an ASJ banner at the airport — were never mapped.
 *
 * The lesson is recorded here because it is cheap to re-learn: `gallery.test.ts`
 * proves the file is PRESENT, and nothing it checks can prove the file is CORRECT.
 * "Ada di disk" is not "benar". If you add an entry, look at the picture.
 *
 * WHY `alt` IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS NOT A KEY
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Alt text describes a specific photograph's content, so it cannot be a translation
 * key the way a heading can — the same key would have to describe eight different
 * pictures. It is written per photo, in Indonesian, and the captions are keys so
 * the language toggle still reaches the surrounding UI. `Object.freeze` guards the
 * array because `getPublicData()` hands out a shared object and sorting one
 * consumer's copy in place would reorder it for every other consumer.

   *
   * ⚠ IT MUST EQUAL THE FILE ON DISK, and that is why the numbers here SHRANK on
   * 2026-09-30. They are not historical records; they are a claim about the
   * current bytes, and `gallery.test.ts` fails if the claim stops being true.

/**
 * THE FILES WERE RE-ENCODED TO THE SIZE THEY ARE DRAWN AT (2026-09-30).
 *
 * Measured before: the landing page cost **2.481 KB over the wire, 2.116 KB of
 * it images (85,3 %)** — see `deliverables/gstack/audit-landing-2026-09-30.md`.
 * A tile here is drawn at **394 px** (341 px at 390), and the files backing it
 * were **1400–1600 px wide**: 3,2–4,7x more pixels than any visitor could see,
 * because there is no lightbox and therefore no larger surface they were being
 * reserved for (see the "NO LIGHTBOX" note in `GalleryGrid.tsx`).
 *
 * They now carry 800 px (1000 px for the one photo also drawn at 499 px in
 * "Tentang Kami"), which still covers a 2x screen at the widest tile. The six
 * files went **1.021 KB -> 389 KB**.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: which photographs are published, their order, their alt
 * text, their captions, and the consent rulings recorded beside them. Only the
 * number of bytes carrying them. The originals are recoverable from git history
 * — the commit before this one holds the full-resolution files.
