/**
 * verify-assets.mjs — the company-profile photos may not be published by accident.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   `docs/COMPANY_PROFILE_DATA.md` §11.2 states a rule about photographs: this
 *   repo is PUBLIC, and the company profile contains faces of identifiable people
 *   — mostly young candidates, some possibly minors. Publishing them through a
 *   git repo is publication without limit and without a way to take it back. The
 *   rule is correct and it had NO ENFORCEMENT AT ALL until this file.
 *
 *   Measured 2026-09-20: 26 `.webp` files were sitting in `public/assets/` in the
 *   untracked state, and `.gitignore` contained not one pattern that mentioned
 *   them. `git add -A` — the command a tired person runs at the end of a session —
 *   would have committed every one of them, permanently, to a public repo. The
 *   only thing standing between the rule and that outcome was somebody reading
 *   §11.2 first. That is not a control, it is a hope.
 *
 *   The `.gitignore` block added alongside this gate closes the immediate hole.
 *   This gate closes the OTHER half, which ignore patterns cannot see: keeping the
 *   three sets in agreement.
 *
 * THE THREE SETS, AND WHY ALL THREE ARE NEEDED
 *
 *   1. ON DISK      what `public/assets/` actually contains
 *   2. PUBLISHED    what the site renders (`GALLERY` in src/lib/gallery.ts, plus
 *                   direct references in src/pages/index.astro)
 *   3. IGNORED      what `.gitignore` refuses to commit
 *
 *   The dangerous mismatch is 2-but-not-3: a photograph the page renders and the
 *   ignore list does not name. That is a face on the public site AND committable,
 *   and every individual step of adding it looks reasonable. The other direction,
 *   3-but-not-2, is merely untidy — it blocks something that is already invisible
 *   — but it is still reported, because a silently-growing ignore list is how the
 *   next person talks themselves into deleting the whole block.
 *
 *   A third check exists because of this repo's own history: the entry in
 *   `GALLERY_EXCLUDED` must never be a member of `GALLERY`. `gallery.test.ts`
 *   already asserts that from inside vitest; repeating it here is deliberate,
 *   because this gate runs in `ci:quality` BEFORE `npm run test`, so it is the one
 *   that fails first when somebody adds a mensetsu poster back.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES *NOT* DO
 *   It does not judge whether a photograph is safe. It cannot — that is a human
 *   decision recorded in `gallery.ts` and §11.2. It only checks that the human
 *   decision is still reflected in all three places at once.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/ci/verify-assets.mjs          gate (exit 1 on a mismatch)
 *   node scripts/ci/verify-assets.mjs --list   print all three sets
 *
 * EXIT CODES
 *   0  the three sets agree
 *   1  a rendered photo is not ignored, or an ignored photo is rendered
 *   2  the gate is looking at the wrong tree

 * face cannot be unpublished. That rule is about PEOPLE. An illustration has no
 * subject who could consent or refuse, so requiring a consent entry for one is
 * not a stricter check — it is a category error that trains the reader to add
 * exemptions, which is how the real check next to it gets weakened.
 *
 * `docs/ILLUSTRATION_SPEC.md` §4 step 5 states the intent: illustrations must
 * not appear in `CONSENT_OPEN` because they have no consent basis. This is that
 * rule, made executable.
 *
 * WHY A SET AND NOT A PATTERN. A path-prefix test (`f.startsWith('ilustrasi/')`)
 * would silently cover every future file dropped in that directory, including a
 * real photograph of a real person. Listing names means adding a file requires a
 * deliberate edit here, which is the moment to ask "is this a drawing?" — the
 * same reasoning OWNER_APPROVED uses.
 *
 * These files were verified to be illustrations, not photographs, by opening
 * them: flat-vector scenes (Mt Fuji, a pagoda, a skyline, a factory, an open
 * book) with no human faces and no photographic content.
 *
 * ⚠ THAT DESCRIPTION IS NOW FALSE FOR ONE MEMBER, AND THE CLAIM IS CORRECTED
 * RATHER THAN LEFT STANDING. `ilustrasi/hero-sakura.webp` was REPLACED on
 * 2026-09-24: the owner supplied a generated 2.75:1 banner (sakura, Fuji, a
 * pagoda, and a figure in an ASJ PORTAL jacket) and asked for it as the profile
 * hero. It is not a flat-vector scene and it does depict a person. The other four
 * are unchanged.
 *
 * WHY IT STAYS IN THIS SET RATHER THAN MOVING TO `OWNER_APPROVED`. The rule this
 * set encodes is not "is it a drawing" — it is "is there a subject who could
 * consent or refuse". `OWNER_APPROVED` is a record of a publication BASIS, and

// (b) An ignore rule naming a file that is not on disk is NORMAL HERE, not a
//     fault — and the first version of this check got that wrong.
//
//     Measured in a clean worktree at HEAD (the R11 pass): the face-bearing
//     photographs are gitignored, so a fresh checkout contains only the 12
//     permitted ones while `.gitignore` names 14 blocked paths. The gate went RED
//     at HEAD while passing on the machine where the photos had been copied.
//
//     That is precisely the false-red R11a exists to prevent, and it came from
//     treating absence as evidence of a typo. The rule's PURPOSE is different:
//     it stops a photograph from being committed on a machine where the file
//     DOES exist (the owner's, where E:\desain\ supplied them). On a machine that
//     never had them, the rule has nothing to do and that is correct.
//
//     So absence is not a violation, but it IS worth surfacing — a rule that is
//     absent everywhere may have been renamed, and the reader deserves to see
//     which rules are currently live. This becomes an informational note handled
//     below rather than a failure.

/**
 * (d2) BLOCKED-FROM-GIT PHOTOGRAPHS MAY NOT BE RENDERED EITHER.
 *
 * This check exists because of a hole this gate's OWN mutation battery found, and
 * it is worth stating precisely because the first version looked complete and was
 * not. The two checks above each have a blind spot when taken alone:
 *
 *   · check (a) asks "rendered AND committable". A photo that IS in .gitignore
 *     passes it — being blocked from git looks like safety.
 *   · check (d) asks "in GALLERY_EXCLUDED and rendered". It only knows the four
 *     photos somebody wrote down.
 *
 * So a photograph that is blocked from git but NOT listed in GALLERY_EXCLUDED
 * passed BOTH. Measured: adding `galeri-mensetsu-okayama.webp` to GALLERY — the
 * exact edit a future contributor makes while "completing" the grid — left the
 * gate at exit 0. The mensetsu posters are in .gitignore but were never added to
 * GALLERY_EXCLUDED, so nothing objected to publishing them.
 *
 * The rule now enforced is the simple one: if a photograph is blocked from git, it
 * does not belong on the page. That is not a stylistic preference — .gitignore
 * blocks exactly the photographs §11.2 says must not be published, so rendering
 * one shows visitors a face that the repo itself refuses to carry.
 *
 * The remedy when this fires is to remove the photo from GALLERY, not to un-ignore
 * it. Record the reason in GALLERY_EXCLUDED so the next person finds it.
